# Frontend Mentor - Fylo data storage component

![Design preview for the Fylo data storage component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Project Log
The real struggle was the range slider! i didn't know how to style it but i found many solutions with a simple search. i didn't test it on firefox , edge and etc, but it looks fine in google chrome, so i think it's good on edge too since it's using Chromium for engine.

* I've fixed the firefox issue, the range slider look perfect in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge!

The rest was simple Flexbox, css and that's it!

PS: I'm starting to write my own README.md files to log my project issues/Notes to my self.
## Note to self
Well, i think this is the last simple challenge i'm gonna do, this feels awfully simple and boring, and i code when i'm bored, so this is not helping!

My next practice project is going to be a whole website page at least, although that's gonna be a little confusing at first. But one way or another, i'm gonna do it.
